# Book.next

A web app for managing your personal reading lists. Users should create an account if they do not already have one, and then go to the "Explore Books" screen to find books they would like to read. If the book they are looking for does not exist, they can add it to the database. Once they have a reading list, users can mark each book as unread, started, or read, or they can remove books from the list.

Interacts with an API at [this gitHub repository](https://github.com/Sofistication/reading-list-api).

## Design Approach

In designing this app, I began by creating the most basic version of the API, and then began to code the client. As the needs of the client surpassed the capabilities of the API, I went back and added in the necessary functionality.
